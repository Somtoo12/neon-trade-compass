      <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Binary to decimal conversion is a fundamental skill in computer science and digital electronics. 
        Whether you're a programming student, IT professional, or digital electronics enthusiast, understanding 
        how to convert between number systems is essential for working with computers at a fundamental level.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="what-is-binary" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">What is Binary and Why Does it Matter?</h3>
      
      <p>
        Binary (base-2) is the language computers speak at their core. Unlike our everyday decimal system that uses 
        ten digits (0-9), binary uses only two digits: 0 and 1. These binary digits, or "bits," are the building blocks 
        of all digital information processing. Every instruction, every piece of data, and every calculation in your 
        computer ultimately boils down to these binary digits.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The reason computers use binary is simple: electronic components can easily represent two states—on or off, 
        high voltage or low voltage. These two states map perfectly to the binary digits 1 and 0.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="binary-to-decimal-conversion-explained" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Binary to Decimal Conversion Explained</h3>
      
      <p>
        Converting from binary to decimal involves understanding place values. In our familiar decimal system, each 
        position represents a power of 10 (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.). In binary, each position represents a power of 2.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Starting from the rightmost digit (least significant bit):
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 my-6">
        <li>First position: 2⁰ = 1</li>
        <li>Second position: 2¹ = 2</li>
        <li>Third position: 2² = 4</li>
        <li>Fourth position: 2³ = 8</li>
        <li>Fifth position: 2⁴ = 16</li>
        <li>And so on...</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each digit by its corresponding place value and sum the results.
      </p>
      
      <div className="bg-secondary/20 p-6 rounded-lg my-8 border border-border/40">
        <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-3">Example: Converting 10110₂ to Decimal</h4>
        
        <p>
          Let's break down the conversion of binary 10110 to decimal:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-none space-y-1 my-4 font-mono">
          <li>1 × 2⁴ = 1 × 16 = 16</li>
          <li>0 × 2³ = 0 × 8 = 0</li>
          <li>1 × 2² = 1 × 4 = 4</li>
          <li>1 × 2¹ = 1 × 2 = 2</li>
          <li>0 × 2⁰ = 0 × 1 = 0</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Sum: 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 22
        </p>
        
        <p className="font-semibold mt-2">
          Therefore, 10110₂ = 22₁₀
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <h3 id="decimal-to-binary-conversion">Decimal to Binary Conversion</h3>
      
      <p>
        Converting from decimal to binary involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 2 and tracking the remainders. 
        The binary representation is formed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Example: Converting 42₁₀ to Binary</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>42 ÷ 2 = 21 with remainder 0</li>
        <li>21 ÷ 2 = 10 with remainder 1</li>
        <li>10 ÷ 2 = 5 with remainder 0</li>
        <li>5 ÷ 2 = 2 with remainder 1</li>
        <li>2 ÷ 2 = 1 with remainder 0</li>
        <li>1 ÷ 2 = 0 with remainder 1</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Reading the remainders from bottom to top: 101010
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Therefore, 42₁₀ = 101010₂

      <h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions About Binary Conversion</h3>
      
      <h4>What is the difference between binary and decimal number systems?</h4>
      <p>
        The decimal system (base-10) uses ten digits (0-9) with place values based on powers of 10, while the binary system (base-2) 
        uses only two digits (0 and 1) with place values based on powers of 2. Decimal is our everyday counting system, while binary 
        is the fundamental language of digital computers.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Why do computers use binary instead of decimal?</h4>
      <p>
        Computers use binary because electronic components naturally have two stable states (on/off, high/low voltage), making binary 
        representation efficient at the hardware level. It's also mathematically simpler to implement logic operations with binary values.
      </p>
      
      <h4>How do I convert large binary numbers to decimal?</h4>
      <p>
        For large binary numbers, it's best to use a tool like our binary to decimal converter. For manual conversion, break the binary 
        number into manageable groups, convert each group, and then combine the results.
      </p>
      
      <h4>What are some common errors when converting binary to decimal?</h4>
      <p>
        Common errors include miscalculating place values, dropping digits, or using incorrect powers of 2. Using our converter eliminates 
        these potential errors and provides instant, accurate results.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Where else is binary used besides computers?</h4>
      <p>
        Binary is used in digital communications, electronic displays, digital signal processing, and any system that processes discrete 
        data. Even the Morse code (dots and dashes) represents a type of binary encoding.

      <p>
        Knowing your daily water target is one thing—actually consuming that amount consistently is another. Here are some 
        practical strategies to help you meet your <strong>optimal daily water intake</strong>:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 my-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Start your day with water</strong>: Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning to rehydrate after sleep.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Carry a reusable water bottle</strong>: Having water readily available makes it easier to sip throughout the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set regular reminders</strong>: Use smartphone alerts or apps designed to remind you to drink water at regular intervals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flavor your water</strong>: If plain water is unappealing, try adding slices of fruit, cucumber, or herbs like mint 
          for natural flavor without calories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eat water-rich foods</strong>: Fruits and vegetables like watermelon, cucumber, oranges, and strawberries have high 
          water content and contribute to your daily intake.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Track your intake</strong>: Use a water tracking app or simply mark a tally on your water bottle to ensure you're 
          meeting your goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drink before, during, and after exercise</strong>: Physical activity increases your hydration needs, so be sure to 
          drink extra water around workouts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="hydration-myths" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Common Hydration Myths Debunked</h3>
      
      <p>
        There's a lot of misinformation about hydration. Let's address some common myths:
      </p>
      
      <h4>Myth 1: Coffee and tea are dehydrating</h4>
      <p>
        While caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea still contribute positively to your 
        daily fluid balance. However, water remains the ideal hydration source.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Myth 2: You need to drink 8 glasses of water every day</h4>
      <p>
        The 8×8 rule (eight 8-ounce glasses) is easy to remember but not scientifically based. Individual hydration needs vary 
        widely based on the factors we've discussed. Our <strong>daily water intake calculator online</strong> provides a more 
        personalized recommendation.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Myth 3: If you're not thirsty, you're hydrated enough</h4>
      <p>
        Thirst is not always a reliable indicator of hydration status, especially in older adults. By the time you feel thirsty, 
        you may already be slightly dehydrated.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Myth 4: You can't drink too much water</h4>
      <p>
        While uncommon, it is possible to drink too much water, leading to a condition called hyponatremia (low sodium levels). 
        This is most common in endurance athletes who drink excessive amounts without replacing electrolytes.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="special-circumstances" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Special Hydration Circumstances</h3>
      
      <p>
        Certain situations require adjustments to your normal hydration routine:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 my-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Exercise</strong>: For workouts lasting less than an hour, water is usually sufficient. For longer or more 
          intense sessions, consider sports drinks with electrolytes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Illness</strong>: Fever, vomiting, or diarrhea can quickly lead to dehydration. Increase fluid intake and 
          consider oral rehydration solutions that replace lost electrolytes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pregnancy and breastfeeding</strong>: Women who are pregnant need about 10 cups (2.4 liters) of fluid daily, 
          while breastfeeding mothers need about 13 cups (3.1 liters).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Air travel</strong>: The low humidity environment in airplane cabins can accelerate dehydration. Drink extra 
          water before and during flights.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Altitude</strong>: Higher elevations increase respiration rate and urine output, accelerating fluid loss. 
          Increase water intake when at high altitudes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Proper hydration is a cornerstone of good health that affects virtually every system in your body. Our 
        <strong> water intake calculator</strong> takes the guesswork out of determining your personal hydration needs, 
        accounting for your unique characteristics and lifestyle factors.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Remember that water needs can change based on circumstances like weather, illness, and activity level. Use our 
        calculator as a baseline guideline and adjust as needed. Pay attention to your body's signals and the color of your 
        urine—pale yellow generally indicates good hydration.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        By maintaining proper hydration, you're supporting your body's essential functions, from cognitive performance to 
        physical endurance, digestive health, and beyond. It's one of the simplest yet most impactful steps you can take 
        toward overall wellness.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="faqs" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Frequently Asked Questions About Water Intake</h3>
      
      <h4>How do I know if I'm drinking enough water?</h4>
      <p>
        The most reliable indicator is the color of your urine. Pale straw to light yellow suggests adequate hydration, while 
        dark yellow or amber indicates you need more water. Other signs of good hydration include regular urination, moist 
        lips and tongue, and good skin elasticity.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Do other beverages count toward my daily water intake?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, most beverages contribute to your hydration status, including tea, coffee, milk, and juice. However, water is 
        still the ideal choice as it contains no calories, sugar, or additives. Alcoholic beverages have a diuretic effect 
        and may contribute to dehydration if consumed in large quantities.
      </p>
      
      <h4>How should I adjust my water intake during exercise?</h4>
      <p>
        A good rule of thumb is to drink about 16-20 oz (0.5-0.6 liters) of water 1-2 hours before exercise, 8 oz (0.2 liters) 
        every 15-20 minutes during exercise, and at least 16-24 oz (0.5-0.7 liters) after exercise for every pound of weight 
        lost during the activity.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Can drinking more water help with weight management?</h4>
      <p>
        Water can support weight management in several ways. It has zero calories, can help you feel fuller before meals, 
        and may slightly boost metabolism. Drinking water instead of caloric beverages like soda or juice can significantly 
        reduce your overall calorie intake.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Is bottled water better than tap water?</h4>
      <p>
        Not necessarily. In many developed countries, tap water meets strict safety standards and is thoroughly tested. 
        Bottled water is convenient but has environmental drawbacks due to plastic waste. If you're concerned about tap water 
        quality, consider using a water filter rather than relying on bottled water.
