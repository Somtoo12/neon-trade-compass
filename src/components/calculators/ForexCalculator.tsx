          <p className="mb-4">
            When it comes to successful forex trading, understanding your pip value is one of the most important factors. Every pip movement can mean the difference between making a profit or experiencing a loss. That's why we've made it easy for you with our free, intuitive Forex Pip Value Calculator.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            This tool is designed to help both beginners and advanced traders quickly determine the exact monetary value of each pip based on their lot size, currency pair, and market prices. With just a few simple inputs, you'll get immediate results that can help you plan your trades with precision, minimize unnecessary risks, and optimize your trading strategy.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why Pip Value Matters in Forex Trading</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Pip value plays a critical role in every trade you place. A pip, which stands for "percentage in point," measures the smallest price movement in the forex market. Knowing the value of each pip in your base currency helps you to:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Size your trades appropriately</li>
            <li>Manage your risk with better stop-loss and take-profit levels</li>
            <li>Understand potential gains or losses before entering a position</li>
            <li>Maintain consistent risk management across all trades</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-6">
            For instance, if you're trading EUR/USD and your pip value is $10 per pip at a standard lot size, every 10-pip movement could equal a $100 profit or loss. Without knowing your pip value in advance, you risk exposing your account to unintended volatility.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">How to Use the PipCraft Pip Value Calculator</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">Our calculator was built with simplicity and speed in mind. Here's how to use it:</p>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6">
            <li className="mb-2">Select Your Currency Pair: Choose the forex pair you are planning to trade, such as EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, or USD/CHF.</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Enter Your Lot Size: Specify the size of your trade (standard, mini, or micro lots). Even a small difference in lot size can drastically change your pip value.</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Input Entry and Exit Prices: Although pip value is primarily based on lot size and currency pair, providing entry and exit prices ensures the tool is tailored to your specific trade idea.</li>
            <li>Click Calculate: Instantly receive the pip value result in your account's base currency, allowing you to adjust your risk accordingly before executing the trade.</li>
          </ol>

          <p className="mb-6">This simple, fast process ensures that every trade you make is backed by solid numbers, not guesswork.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why Choose PipCraft's Forex Pip Calculator?</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">While there are many pip calculators available online, PipCraft's calculator is uniquely optimized for speed, clarity, and user-friendliness. Here's why traders trust it:</p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Many successful traders know that precision in trading starts long before entering a trade. With PipCraft's pip calculator, you gain that precision every time you plan a new position.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Trading Examples Using Pip Value</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Let's say you are trading GBP/USD with a 0.10 lot size (a mini lot). If your calculated pip value is $1 per pip, a 50-pip gain would result in a $50 profit. Similarly, a 20-pip loss would mean a $20 loss.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Without a pip calculator, you might underestimate or overestimate your exposure, leading to poor risk management. Smart traders always know their numbers first—and that's exactly what our tool helps you achieve.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Final Thoughts: Master Your Trading with Precision</h3>
